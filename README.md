# School_C-_Projects
	This is a repository of all the source codes I've worked on in school,
	almost all of them being usually made by my teacher and corrected by me,
	but keeping the framework basically. I don't take the blame for the 
	messy coding :))

## The unorganized cpp files
	These are either classwork, actual programs we were supposed to write to,
	say, learn the concepts, but some of these seem to be Timus problems I did
	in my spare time. Poor organization, tho.
## InfoArena
	Here are some problems from the site with the same name as the folder, which
	is actually pretty popular in my country for competitive programming.
## Teza_mai_2018
	For the test paper, we were drawing tickets with numbers on them, which meant
	a specific problem from a set, all the time problems we have discussed during
	the semester. People tend to cheat on this exam, by bringing a USB drive with
	all the code sources. I said I'd help them with some problems, so there's that.
## Oscilations
	This was for a Physics project, actually. I was meant to talk about waves, so
	I made this visualiser, in C++; It takes some arguments, I don't remember now
	which, specific to every wave, and then it starts to live-draw it on the 
	screen.
## Fondul Clasei
	I was designated the fund collector of the class. You know, for the chalk and
	all the rest. As I have learned a bit about databases, I took it as a challenge
	to actually make something helpful in this regard. Then, I had to decide which
	programming language to use, and I went for python, just because I never used 
	it before.
